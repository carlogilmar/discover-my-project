## Development

I implemented a git hook for add some valuable tools, so please for development then to clone this repo, run the *install_credo_hooks.sh* script. This script will install a *pre-push* git hook in this repo.

The main goal for this hook is run credo before to make a push to the remote repository, if there are some credo suggestions, the push will be stopped, if you don't have suggestions the push will be uploaded.

Example

I made this for ensure quality in the code analysis made by *Credo*

## Discover My Project

The main goal is explore an open source project through the git data and the github information. It's inspired in [Git Stats Ruby Gem](https://github.com/tomgi/git_stats).
